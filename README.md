Basic Spring Application Cont.

Below is a step-by-step description of what the code does:

A package named “model” is created, which contains the model classes (Book and Author). These classes are annotated with
@Entity to indicate that they are JPA entities and will be mapped to database tables. The Book class has a @ManyToOne
relationship with the Author class to establish the association between books and their authors.

A package named “repository” is created, which contains the repository interfaces (BookRepository and AuthorRepository).
These interfaces extend JpaRepository, which provides predefined methods for performing database operations such as
saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.

A package named ”controller” is created, which contains the controllers (BookController and AuthorController). These
controllers are annotated with @Controller and define the access routes through the @RequestMapping annotation. The
controllers use the repositories to interact with the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
operations on books and authors.

The views are created using Thymeleaf in the "templates" directory. HTML files are provided for the CRUD operations of
books and authors. These views use Thymeleaf syntax to dynamically display and manipulate the data.

The BookController class defines methods to list books, create books, update books, and delete books. Each method
performs the corresponding operations using the book repository (BookRepository).

The AuthorController is similar to BookController and defines methods to list authors, create authors, update authors,
and delete authors. Each method uses the author repository (AuthorRepository) to perform the respective operations.

The HomeController handles requests for the home page ("/"). It returns the "home" view template and adds a "message"
attribute to the model, which displays a welcome message. Unlike the BookController and AuthorController, it doesn't
interact with repositories or perform CRUD operations on books or authors.

In addition to the previous description, the code also includes form validations. The Book and Author classes are annotated with @NotNull, @Size, and @NotEmpty annotations to validate the form inputs. 
These annotations ensure that the book title and author name are not empty or too short.

Furthermore, the controllers have been updated to handle validation. The methods that handle POST requests are annotated with @Valid, which triggers the validation process for the form data. If there are validation errors, the controller returns the form view, allowing the user to correct the input. If there are no errors, the controller proceeds with saving the data.

In summary, the code sets up a basic book and author management system using Spring MVC and Spring Data JPA. It provides
access routes to perform CRUD operations on books and authors and uses Thymeleaf to create the corresponding HTML views.
